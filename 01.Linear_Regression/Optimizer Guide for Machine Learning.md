## üî¢ Types of Gradient Descent

| Type                                  | Description                                            | Optimizers Used                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Batch Gradient Descent**            | Uses the full dataset to compute gradients             | Rarely used with Adam, too slow                 |
| **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** | Updates weights using one sample at a time             | Needs stabilizing methods like Momentum or Adam |
| **Mini-batch Gradient Descent**       | Updates weights using small batches (e.g., 32 samples) | Works best with all advanced optimizers         |

**Mini-batch Gradient Descent** is most widely used in deep learning because it balances speed and stability.

## üîÑ Optimization Algorithms

| Optimizer                         | Works With                        | Best When...                                     |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **SGD**                           | Small data, convex problems       | You want simplicity and direct control           |
| **SGD + Momentum**                | Deep learning, noisy surfaces     | To speed up convergence and reduce zig-zagging   |
| **Nesterov Accelerated Gradient** | Deep learning                     | Same as momentum but anticipates gradient        |
| **Adagrad**                       | Sparse features (e.g., NLP, text) | Good when some features are infrequent           |
| **RMSprop**                       | RNNs, non-stationary targets      | Solves Adagrad's decay problem                   |
| **Adam**                          | Most deep learning                | Combines momentum + RMSprop; default in practice |
| **AdamW**                         | Deep learning with regularization | Improves generalization, better weight decay     |
| **AdaBound**                      | Stability in convergence          | Adaptive bound for learning rate                 |

## ‚úÖ When to Use What ‚Äî By Purpose

| Training Scenario                                    | Optimizer to Use           | Why                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Convex function, small data (like linear regression) | Batch GD or SGD + Momentum | Simple and efficient                |
| Deep Neural Network (MLP, CNN, etc.)                 | Adam or AdamW              | Fast convergence, adaptive learning |
| Text / NLP / Sparse data                             | Adagrad or Adam            | Good for rare word handling         |
| Time series or RNNs                                  | RMSprop or Adam            | Deals with non-stationarity         |
| Fast training + generalization                       | AdamW + weight decay       | Better generalization than Adam     |
| Low memory hardware                                  | SGD with small batch       | Lightest on memory and compute      |

## üß† Why Mini-batch is Most Common

- More stable than pure SGD
- Faster than full batch GD
- Works seamlessly with advanced optimizers (Adam, RMSprop, etc.)

> **Mini-batch GD** hits the sweet spot for speed, stability, and efficiency.

---

## ‚ö° Rule of Thumb

> If you're unsure:
>
> - Use **Adam** with a **mini-batch size** of 32 or 64
> - Learning rate: start with `1e-3`
> - Use **AdamW** + **weight decay** for better generalization

## üí° Real-World Usage Examples

| Use Case                          | Typical Setup                           |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Linear Regression                 | Batch GD or SGD + Momentum              |
| Small tabular dataset             | SGD + Momentum or Adam                  |
| Deep CNN for image classification | Mini-batch + Adam                       |
| Transformer / LLM                 | AdamW with learning rate warm-up        |
| Training instability              | Try Nesterov or RMSprop                 |
| Overfitting                       | Use AdamW or apply dropout/weight decay |

## üîç Additional Notes

- **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Helps fine-tune convergence (e.g., reduce LR when plateauing).
- **Gradient Clipping**: Prevents exploding gradients, especially in RNNs.
- **Flat minima vs Sharp minima**: Optimizers like AdamW encourage flatter solutions that generalize better.

---

## üìå Summary

- Use **Mini-batch GD** with **Adam** or **AdamW** for most practical deep learning tasks.
- For simpler problems (like linear models), **SGD** or **SGD with Momentum** is sufficient.
- Choose optimizers based on **data type**, **model type**, and **hardware constraints**.

Let this guide help you select the best tool for training efficient, stable, and generalizable machine learning models.
