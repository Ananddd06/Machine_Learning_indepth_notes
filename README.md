# 🌟 Machine Learning In-depth Notes

Welcome to **Machine Learning In-depth Notes** 📘✨ — an **open-source collection** of **from-scratch implementations** of Machine Learning algorithms.  
This project covers **Supervised** 🤖 and **Unsupervised** 🔍 learning methods, each paired with its **research paper PDF** 📄.  
Our mission is to **learn by building**, understanding ML from the ground up, and making it accessible to everyone!  

We’re not stopping here 🚦 — coming soon: **NLP 📝, Deep Learning 🧠, and Transformers ⚡**.

## 🔎 Overview
This repo is a **hands-on learning resource**. Each algorithm is:
- ✅ Implemented from scratch (no shortcuts!)  
- 📄 Documented with the original **research paper**  
- 📓 Accompanied by Python scripts & Jupyter Notebooks for demos  

Our goal is to create a **living library** of ML knowledge — **practical + theoretical**.

# 📖 Research Papers

Every algorithm includes its foundational research paper 📄.  
Examples:  
- `supervised/linear_regression/paper.pdf` → Linear Regression theory  
- `unsupervised/kmeans/paper.pdf` → K-Means original paper  

This way, you can connect **code ↔ theory** easily.
